## 1. Introduction  
"Save Image As What" is a Chrome extension that allows users to save images in different formats (PNG, JPG, WebP) via the right-click menu.  

We respect your privacy and ensure that this extension operates with minimal data collection.

## 2. Data Collection  

- **No Personal Data Collected**  
This extension does **not** collect, store, or share any personal information.  

- **No Tracking or Analytics**  
We do **not** use cookies, analytics, or any tracking technologies.  

- **Third-Party API Usage**  
This extension uses the **AllOrigins API** (`https://api.allorigins.win/raw?url=`) to bypass CORS restrictions and fetch images from external sites.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This API acts as a proxy but does **not** store or track your requests.
> No personally identifiable information is sent or processed.

## 3. Permissions Used & Justification  

We request the **minimum necessary permissions** for the extension to function properly:  

| Permission      | Why Itâ€™s Needed |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `contextMenus` | Adds the "Save Image As What" option when right-clicking on images. |
| `downloads` | Enables saving images in different formats to your device. |
| `activeTab` | Ensures the extension operates only when necessary on the active tab. |

We take security seriously:  
- All operations happen **locally** in your browser.  
- No data is transmitted outside your device, **except for image requests to AllOrigins API** to bypass CORS issues.  
- We do **not** store or sell any data.
